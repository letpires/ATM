## üè¶ Description
This project is an automated teller machine (ATM) simulator implemented in Python. It offers an interactive experience, allowing users to simulate basic banking operations.

## üìÑ Repository structure

- ATM project without database connection [ATM WITHOUT DB](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/atm_bank_%7BNO_db_%20connection%7D.py);
- ATM project with database connection [ATM WITH DB CONNECTION](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/atm_bank_%7Bdb_%20connection%7D.py);
- Script SQL para conex√£o do simulador [SCRIPT SQL](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/script_sql.sql).

## üöÄ Features

- **User Options Menu:** allows the user to carry out various banking operations;
- **Admin options menu:** administrative access for advanced settings (Admin account: 211001; PIN: 123);
- **Account Operations:** account balance, deposit, withdrawal;
- **History of banking transactions;**
- **Generation of number of transactions:** each transaction receives a unique number;
- **Data visualization:** graphs to represent the account balance over time;
- **Number of fixed accounts:** predefined accounts for simulation.

  
## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

To run this ATM simulator project in Python, you need to have **Python 3** installed on your machine. Furthermore, the project depends on some specific libraries. It is essential to have the `mysql-connector-python` library installed to manage the connection to the MySQL database. For calculation and data visualization functionalities, the **numpy** and **matplotlib** libraries are equally important. Make sure you have all of these dependencies installed to ensure the simulator works correctly.

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository;
2. Install dependencies;
3. Execute ATM simulator.

## Database access

To configure the database for the ATM simulator, follow these steps:

### 1. Running the Configuration SQL Script

Before using the simulator, you must configure the database by running an SQL script. This script will create the necessary tables and structures in your database.

- Open your database management system (such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.).
- Connect to your local database.
- Run the SQL script available in this repository - [CLICK HERE TO ACCESS](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/script_sql.sql).

### 2. Changing Database Credentials in Simulator Code

- Open the [ATM file](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/atm_bank_%7Bdb_%20connection%7D.py) and look for the function **CreateConnection()**;
- Change the connection information to match your local database credentials.
- Save the file with the new settings.

## ‚ö° Contribution

Your contribution is very welcome in this project! If you have ideas to improve the ATM simulator or want to add new features, feel free to suggest changes.

## üî• ATM Challenge!

This challenge aims to create an interactive user interface for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator using Streamlit in Python or another tool of your choice. Streamlit is an excellent tool for data scientists and Python programmers to quickly create web applications.

I have already started the challenge using Streamlit. I only created the interface, without adding it to the ATM code. The code is available by [CLICKING HERE](https://github.com/letpires/ATM/blob/main/atm_streamlit.py). And to run this application you can run the line of code below

```py -m streamlit run atm_streamlit.py```

It's an excellent opportunity to test your skills, collaborate and learn moreüòä

### Share your work!

After completing your interface, share your work by sending screenshots, videos or the code itself. Use the hashtag ***#ATMChallenge*** on your social media to share your progress and see what others are creating.
